# A Graphical Programming Language Editor

<sup>Candidate Number: 198719</sup> <br>
<sup>Supervisor: Dr Ian Mackie</sup>

## Motivations
The motivation behind this project it that it will push my Java programming skills to limit, and experience designing software for other people rather than just for my own benefit. This will help me put my focus on the user's goals rather than my own. Additionally, I can put this project on my portfolio to show future employers!

This project will further put content learnt from modules in my degree to practice. Time management techniques from Software Engineering will help me manage when and what I should be focusing on. Furthermore, concepts learnt from Human Computer Interaction will aid me in focussing on user design for the user's goals; implementing a user interface that everyone will be able to use effectively.

Finally, the ability to use Java this extensively will most definitely improve my proficiency of the skill.

## Aims
The aim of this project is to design and implement a user friendly interface for the user to graphically program basic functions. Simple functions may include:
- loops.
  - this includes <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.
- conditional statements, such as <code>if</code>.
- implementing and interacting with data structures, such as lists.

This is necessary as it provides another programming viewpoint for the user, which can aid them understand the process and flow of how said program may be running. It is also friendly and less intimidating for newer users, relative to a textual/command line script.

I am going to program this is Java, my most experienced language, making use of Java's smart GUI design feature, whilst learning and building knowledge on said feature for my own experience.

## Objectives

The main objectives are:
1. To investigate system requirements and produce a requirements specification.
2. To select and justify an appropiate research design for the project.
3. Implement a simple user-friendly interface which is easy to use.
4. Functional and working loops, conditionals and data stuctures that can be interacted with.

### Exta Objectives
1. Colour coordinate the different functions.
   - for instance, the loops and conditionals can be coloured differently to show more clearly what they represent.
2. Implement an undo button.
3. Implement a redo button.
4. Testing by a regular user, of the software.

## Relevance

This project involves modules across my degree, from further programming and

This project will test my ability to understand the user's perspective and struggles, rather than my own when designing the interface for them to use.







This project not only involves the development of software, but also involves analysis and evaluation of software, HCI design principles, user-testing and the potential for the development of network tools. This project will test not only my technical skills as a programmer but also my ability to critically assess my work and the work of others, organise and conduct user-testing, gather requirements via interviews and manage an agile-developed project using user-centered design. Thereby, this project will test my ability to utilise many of the skills of my degree in a way they are likely to be utilised beyond my university education.

As a TTRPG player of 7 years, with 4 of which as a Game Master, this project also incorporates my personal hobbies and interests. The first games I ever played in used digital tools to facilitate play and I have been using digital tools in my own games for two and a half years now. I personally use 7 separate pieces of software to facilitate my games and there are still several things I wish my software could do and many things I wish could be integrated between them. This project provides me the opportunity to attempt to solve a problem I have encountered in my own life by bringing my technical skills and my personal interests together.

## Resources Required

None, I think haha but pretty sure no resources required.

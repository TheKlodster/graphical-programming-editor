## Working Title


*the working title should be a good indication of what your project is about. The working title will be used in choosing examiners for your project. You can change the title for your final report. If you change the topic, you should change the working title to reflect this and inform the project coordinator of the change. You should only change the topic by agreement with your supervisor.*

## Aims and Objectives
*aims describe purpose and intention and include a description of your motivations for undertaking this particular topic. Objectives relate to the expected outcomes of the project. You should break these down into 'primary objectives' which you guarantee to achieve and 'extensions' which will only be implemented if time allows. The primary objectives should be clearly specified, but the extensions may be vaguer. Do not be afraid to specify more extensions than you will be able to implement.*

## Relevance
*write a short paragraph to explain how this project relates to your degree course.*

## Resources Required
*it is your responsibility to make sure that the resources you need are available. Do not expect the department to buy things you need. (If you are going to use something not normally supported by the department you will need to obtain approval from your supervisor.)*

## Personal Timetable
*Copy of your personal weekly timetable indicating lectures, tutorials and periods of the week you intend to devote to your project.*
